## The Problem
Remodeling and construction projects can be complex processes, involving multiple items, staggered payments, and risks of budget overruns. The lack of a structured management tool often leads to:

- **Lack of transparency**: Clients do not have a clear view of progress and real costs.  
- **Uncontrolled budget deviations**: Unexpected changes inflate costs without proper tracking.  
- **Disorganized payments**: There's no clear method to release payments based on actual progress.  
- **Insufficient documentation**: No standardized system to validate materials, progress, and cost justifications.  
- **Deteriorated trust**: The lack of oversight undermines trust between clients and professionals.

---

## The Solution: BuildTrack
BuildTrack is a platform designed to manage remodeling projects in a structured and transparent way, ensuring detailed control of progress, payments, and budget deviations. It streamlines communication between clients and professionals, enabling precise real-time project tracking.

**Key Benefits:**
- A single platform for financial control and deviation tracking.  
- Task and milestone management to avoid confusion during execution.  
- Easy communication among all parties involved.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React with Material UI
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **State Management:** React Hooks and Context
- **UI Components:** Material-UI v5
- **API Integration:** RESTful endpoints
- **Real-time Updates:** Auto-refresh mechanisms

These technologies have been implemented and tested in production.

## Budget Deviations Tracking
- Each item/part of the project has an **assigned initial budget**.  
- **Deviations** are logged when there are differences between the estimated budget and actual spending.  
- The **reason for the deviation** is recorded (unexpected issues, material changes, extra labor costs).  
- The **percentage of deviation** is calculated for each item.  
- A dashboard provides real-time data on:
  - **Initial budget vs. current expenses**  
  - **Absolute difference (â‚¬) and percentage of deviation (%)**  
- Upon completion, a **cost report** is generated, including:
  - Total initial budget  
  - Total actual spending  
  - Total deviation in both euros and percentage  
  - Option to export a PDF or Excel report

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BuildTrack.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   For backend:
   ```bash
   cd BuildTrack/backend
   npm install
   ```
   For frontend:
   ```bash
   cd BuildTrack/frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
   - Database connection details
   - JWT secret key
   - Server port (default: 3000)
   
   Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:
   - Backend API URL
   - Frontend port (default: 3001)

4. **Run the application**  
   Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   Start the frontend in a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   
   The backend will run on http://localhost:3000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3001
