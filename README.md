## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/build-track.git
   cd build-track
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables (optional):**  
   If your project requires credentials, tokens, or special paths, create an `.env` file in the root directory and define them there:
   ```
   API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
   DB_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_URL
   ```
4. **Run the project in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Usage

Once you’ve completed the installation and environment setup:

1. **Open the application** in your browser at the URL provided in the console (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).  
2. **Create and manage tasks** from the main dashboard.  
3. **Track progress** of your team and visualize overall performance statistics.  
4. **Automate workflows** by connecting to external services, if enabled.

> Adjust these steps according to your project’s architecture or features.
