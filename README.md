## The Problem
Remodeling and construction projects can be complex processes, involving multiple items, staggered payments, and risks of budget overruns. The lack of a structured management tool often leads to:

- **Lack of transparency**: Clients do not have a clear view of progress and real costs.  
- **Uncontrolled budget deviations**: Unexpected changes inflate costs without proper tracking.  
- **Disorganized payments**: There’s no clear method to release payments based on actual progress.  
- **Insufficient documentation**: No standardized system to validate materials, progress, and cost justifications.  
- **Deteriorated trust**: The lack of oversight undermines trust between clients and professionals.

---

## The Solution: BuildTrack
BuildTrack is a platform designed to manage remodeling projects in a structured and transparent way, ensuring detailed control of progress, payments, and budget deviations. It streamlines communication between clients and professionals, enabling precise real-time project tracking.

**Key Benefits:**
- A single platform for financial control and deviation tracking.  
- Task and milestone management to avoid confusion during execution.  
- Easy communication among all parties involved.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React/React Native or Flutter  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or Django  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or Auth0  
- **Payment:** Stripe or PayPal  

These technologies are suggested and may vary based on project needs.

## Key Features
1. **Registration & Authentication**: Account creation for clients and professionals.  
2. **Project Creation**: Definition of remodeling projects with details, phases, and agreed payments.  
3. **Task/Milestone Management**: Division of the project into tasks, complete with percentage of completion and validation.  
4. **Payment System**: Staggered payment methods like 50%-50%, 30-30-40, or milestone-based payments.  
5. **Validation & Documentation**: Photo uploads and receipts for materials and progress tracking.  
6. **Dashboard**: Real-time tracking of project progress, payments, and documentation.  
7. **Feedback & Reviews**: Rating and review system to build transparency and trust.

## Budget Deviations Tracking
- Each item/part of the project has an **assigned initial budget**.  
- **Deviations** are logged when there are differences between the estimated budget and actual spending.  
- The **reason for the deviation** is recorded (unexpected issues, material changes, extra labor costs).  
- The **percentage of deviation** is calculated for each item.  
- A dashboard provides real-time data on:
  - **Initial budget vs. current expenses**  
  - **Absolute difference (€) and percentage of deviation (%)**  
- Upon completion, a **cost report** is generated, including:
  - Total initial budget  
  - Total actual spending  
  - Total deviation in both euros and percentage  
  - Option to export a PDF or Excel report
